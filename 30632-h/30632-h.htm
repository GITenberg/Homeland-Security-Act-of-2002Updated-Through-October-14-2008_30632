            (2) Amount required.--The amount required under
        this paragraph shall, for any fiscal year, be the
        amount under subparagraph (A) or (B), whichever is

            (4) Final basic pay defined.--In this subsection,
        the term ``final basic pay'' means, with respect to an

        with appropriate adjustment therefor.

An individual who receives a voluntary separation incentive
payment under this section and who, within 5 years after the
date of the separation on which the payment is based, accepts
any compensated employment with the Government or works for any
agency of the Government through a personal services contract,

of employment, the entire amount of the incentive payment. Such
payment shall be made to the covered entity from which the
individual separated or, if made on or after the transfer date,
to the Deputy Secretary or the Under Secretary for Border and

        make other positions available to more critical
        locations or more critical occupations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The phrase ``, the National Disaster Medical System,'' in
subsection (a)(3)(B) probably should not appear. Section 301(c)(1) of
Public Law 109-417 (120 Stat. 2854) provides for an amendment to the
Homeland Security Act of 2002 as follows:

          (1) in section 502(3)(B), by striking ``, the National
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Disaster Medical System,''; and

     The amendment was not executed because section 502 of the Homeland
Security Act of 2002 was redesignated as section 504 by section 611(8)
of Public Law 109-295 (120 Stat 1395).

                        accreditation and certification program
                        under this subsection; and
                            (ii) after the adoption of one or
                        more standards under clause (i), may

                        use of voluntary preparedness standards
                        for the accreditation and certification
                        program, as necessary and appropriate

                Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)) for the program
                under this subsection.
                    (E) Considerations.--In developing and
                implementing the program under this subsection,
                the designated officer shall--
                            (i) consider the unique nature of
                        various sectors within the private
                        sector, including preparedness
                        standards, business continuity
                        standards, or best practices,
                        established--
                                    (I) under any other
                                provision of Federal law; or
                                    (II) by any sector-specific
                                agency, as defined under

                                private sector related
                                programs; and
                                    (II) preparedness and
                                business continuity programs in
                                other Federal agencies.
            (3) Accreditation and certification processes.--

                        11 Commission Act of 2007, the
                        designated officer shall enter into one
                        or more agreements with a highly
                        qualified nongovernmental entity with
                        experience or expertise in coordinating
                        and facilitating the development and
                        use of voluntary consensus standards
                        and in managing or implementing
                        accreditation and certification
                        programs for voluntary consensus
                        standards, or a similarly qualified
                        private sector entity, to carry out
                        accreditations and oversee the
                        certification process under this
                        subsection. An entity entering into an
                        agreement with the designated officer
                        under this clause (hereinafter referred
                        to in this section as a ``selected
                        entity'') shall not perform
                        certifications under this subsection.
                            (ii) Contents.--A selected entity
                        shall manage the accreditation process

                        in accordance with the program
                        established under this subsection and
                        accredit qualified third parties to
                        carry out the certification program
                        established under this subsection.
                    (B) Procedures and requirements for
                accreditation and certification.--
                            (i) In general.--Any selected
                        entity shall collaborate to develop
                        procedures and requirements for the
                        accreditation and certification
                        processes under this subsection, in
                        accordance with the program established
                        under this subsection and guidelines
                        developed under paragraph (2)(A)(ii).
                            (ii) Contents and use.--The
                        procedures and requirements developed
                        under clause (i) shall--
                                    (I) ensure reasonable
                                uniformity in any accreditation
                                and certification processes if
                                there is more than one selected
                                entity; and
                                    (II) be used by any
                                selected entity in conducting
                                accreditations and overseeing
                                the certification process under
                                this subsection.
                            (iii) Disagreement.--Any
                        disagreement among selected entities in
                        developing procedures under clause (i)
                        shall be resolved by the designated
                        officer.
                    (C) Designation.--A selected entity may
                accredit any qualified third party to carry out
                the certification process under this
                subsection.
                    (D) Disadvantaged business involvement.--In
                accrediting qualified third parties to carry
                out the certification process under this
                subsection, a selected entity shall ensure, to
                the extent practicable, that the third parties
                include qualified small, minority, women-owned,
                or disadvantaged business concerns when
                appropriate. The term ``disadvantaged business
                concern'' means a small business that is owned
                and controlled by socially and economically
                disadvantaged individuals, as defined in
                section 124 of title 13, United States Code of
                Federal Regulations.
                    (E) Treatment of other certifications.--At
                the request of any entity seeking
                certification, any selected entity may
                consider, as appropriate, other relevant
                certifications acquired by the entity seeking
                certification. If the selected entity
                determines that such other certifications are
                sufficient to meet the certification
                requirement or aspects of the certification
                requirement under this section, the selected
                entity may give credit to the entity seeking
                certification, as appropriate, to avoid
                unnecessarily duplicative certification
                requirements.
                    (F) Third parties.--To be accredited under
                subparagraph (C), a third party shall--
                            (i) demonstrate that the third
                        party has the ability to certify
                        private sector entities in accordance
                        with the procedures and requirements
                        developed under subparagraph (B);
                            (ii) agree to perform
                        certifications in accordance with such
                        procedures and requirements;
                            (iii) agree not to have any
                        beneficial interest in or any direct or
                        indirect control over--
                                    (I) a private sector entity
                                for which that third party
                                conducts a certification under
                                this subsection; or
                                    (II) any organization that
                                provides preparedness
                                consulting services to private
                                sector entities;
                            (iv) agree not to have any other
                        conflict of interest with respect to
                        any private sector entity for which
                        that third party conducts a
                        certification under this subsection;
                            (v) maintain liability insurance
                        coverage at policy limits in accordance
                        with the requirements developed under
                        subparagraph (B); and
                            (vi) enter into an agreement with
                        the selected entity accrediting that
                        third party to protect any proprietary
                        information of a private sector entity
                        obtained under this subsection.
                    (G) Monitoring.--
                            (i) In general.--The designated
                        officer and any selected entity shall
                        regularly monitor and inspect the
                        operations of any third party
                        conducting certifications under this
                        subsection to ensure that the third
                        party is complying with the procedures
                        and requirements established under
                        subparagraph (B) and all other
                        applicable requirements.
                            (ii) Revocation.--If the designated
                        officer or any selected entity

                        meeting the procedures or requirements
                        established under subparagraph (B), the
                        selected entity shall--
                                    (I) revoke the
                                accreditation of that third
                                party to conduct certifications
                                under this subsection; and

                                certification conducted by that

                consensus standards development organizations,
                appropriate representatives of State and local
                governments, including emergency management
                officials, and each private sector advisory
                council created under section 102(f)(4), shall
                annually review the voluntary accreditation and
                certification program established under this
                subsection to ensure the effectiveness of such
                program (including the operations and

            (5) Voluntary participation.--Certification under
        this subsection shall be voluntary for any private
        sector entity.

        sector entity certified as being in compliance with the
        program established under this subsection, if that
        private sector entity consents to such listing.
    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be

            (1) In general.--When the Secretary carries out
        basic, applied, and advanced research and development
        projects, including the expenditure of funds for such
        projects, the Secretary may exercise the same authority
        (subject to the same limitations and conditions) with
        respect to such research and projects as the Secretary
        of Defense may exercise under section 2371 of title 10,
        United States Code (except for subsections (b) and
        (f)), after making a determination that the use of a
        contract, grant, or cooperative agreement for such
        project is not feasible or appropriate. The annual
        report required under subsection (b) of this section,
        as applied to the Secretary by this paragraph, shall be
        submitted to the President of the Senate and the

        under section 845 of the National Defense Authorization
        Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160). In
        applying the authorities of that section 845,
        subsection (c) of that section shall apply with respect
        to prototype projects under this paragraph, and the
        Secretary shall perform the functions of the Secretary
        of Defense under subsection (d) thereof.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the effective
date of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Comptroller
General shall report to the Committee on Government Reform of
the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental
Affairs of the Senate on--
            (1) whether use of the authorities described in
        subsection (a) attracts nontraditional Government
        contractors and results in the acquisition of needed
        technologies; and
            (2) if such authorities were to be made permanent,
        whether additional safeguards are needed with respect
        to the use of such authorities.
    (c) Procurement of Temporary and Intermittent Services.--
The Secretary may--
            (1) procure the temporary or intermittent services
        of experts or consultants (or organizations thereof) in
        accordance with section 3109(b) of title 5, United
        States Code; and
            (2) whenever necessary due to an urgent homeland
        security need, procure temporary (not to exceed 1 year)
        or intermittent personal services, including the
        services of experts or consultants (or organizations
        thereof), without regard to the pay limitations of such
        section 3109.
    (d) Additional Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--The authority of the Secretary
        under this section shall terminate September 30, 2009,
        unless before that date the Secretary--
                    (A) issues policy guidance detailing the
                appropriate use of that authority; and
                    (B) provides training to each employee that
                is authorized to exercise that authority.
            (2) Report.--The Secretary shall provide an annual
        report to the Committees on Appropriations of the
        Senate and the House of Representatives, the Committee
        on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the
        Senate, and the Committee on Homeland Security of the
        House of Representatives detailing the projects for
        which the authority granted by subsection (a) was used,
        the rationale for its use, the funds spent using that
        authority, the outcome of each project for which that
        authority was used, and the results of any audits of
        such projects.
    (e) Definition of Nontraditional Government Contractor.--In
this section, the term ``nontraditional Government contractor''
has the same meaning as the term ``nontraditional defense
contractor'' as defined in section 845(e) of the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-
160; 10 U.S.C. 2371 note).

SEC. 863. [6 U.S.C. 442] LITIGATION MANAGEMENT.

    (a) Federal Cause of Action.--
            (1) In general.--There shall exist a Federal cause
        of action for claims arising out of, relating to, or
        resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-
        terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense
        against or response or recovery from such act and such
        claims result or may result in loss to the Seller. The
        substantive law for decision in any such action shall
        be derived from the law, including choice of law
        principles, of the State in which such acts of
        terrorism occurred, unless such law is inconsistent
        with or preempted by Federal law. Such Federal cause of
        action shall be brought only for claims for injuries
        that are proximately caused by sellers that provide
        qualified anti-terrorism technology to Federal and non-
        Federal government customers.
            (2) Jurisdiction.--Such appropriate district court
        of the United States shall have original and exclusive
        jurisdiction over all actions for any claim for loss of
        property, personal injury, or death arising out of,
        relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when
        qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been
        deployed in defense against or response or recovery
        from such act and such claims result or may result in
        loss to the Seller.
    (b) Special Rules.--In an action brought under this section
for damages the following provisions apply:
            (1) Punitive damages.--No punitive damages intended
        to punish or deter, exemplary damages, or other damages
        not intended to compensate a plaintiff for actual
        losses may be awarded, nor shall any party be liable
        for interest prior to the judgment.
            (2) Noneconomic damages.--
                    (A) In general.--Noneconomic damages may be
                awarded against a defendant only in an amount
                directly proportional to the percentage of
                responsibility of such defendant for the harm
                to the plaintiff, and no plaintiff may recover
                noneconomic damages unless the plaintiff
                suffered physical harm.
                    (B) Definition.--For purposes of
                subparagraph (A), the term ``noneconomic
                damages'' means damages for losses for physical
                and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience,
                physical impairment, mental anguish,
                disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss
                of society and companionship, loss of
                consortium, hedonic damages, injury to
                reputation, and any other nonpecuniary losses.
    (c) Collateral Sources.--Any recovery by a plaintiff in an
action under this section shall be reduced by the amount of
collateral source compensation, if any, that the plaintiff has
received or is entitled to receive as a result of such acts of
terrorism that result or may result in loss to the Seller.
    (d) Government Contractor Defense.--
            (1) In general.--Should a product liability or
        other lawsuit be filed for claims arising out of,
        relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when
        qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by the
        Secretary, as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of
        this subsection, have been deployed in defense against
        or response or recovery from such act and such claims
        result or may result in loss to the Seller, there shall
        be a rebuttable presumption that the government
        contractor defense applies in such lawsuit. This
        presumption shall only be overcome by evidence showing
        that the Seller acted fraudulently or with willful
        misconduct in submitting information to the Secretary
        during the course of the Secretary's consideration of
        such technology under this subsection. This presumption
        of the government contractor defense shall apply
        regardless of whether the claim against the Seller
        arises from a sale of the product to Federal Government
        or non-Federal Government customers.
            (2) Exclusive responsibility.--The Secretary will
        be exclusively responsible for the review and approval
        of anti-terrorism technology for purposes of
        establishing a government contractor defense in any
        product liability lawsuit for claims arising out of,
        relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when
        qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by the
        Secretary, as provided in this paragraph and paragraph
        (3), have been deployed in defense against or response
        or recovery from such act and such claims result or may
        result in loss to the Seller. Upon the Seller's
        submission to the Secretary for approval of anti-
        terrorism technology, the Secretary will conduct a
        comprehensive review of the design of such technology
        and determine whether it will perform as intended,
        conforms to the Seller's specifications, and is safe
        for use as intended. The Seller will conduct safety and
        hazard analyses on such technology and will supply the
        Secretary with all such information.
            (3) Certificate.--For anti-terrorism technology
        reviewed and approved by the Secretary, the Secretary
        will issue a certificate of conformance to the Seller
        and place the anti-terrorism technology on an Approved
        Product List for Homeland Security.
    (e) Exclusion.--Nothing in this section shall in any way
limit the ability of any person to seek any form of recovery
from any person, government, or other entity that--
            (1) attempts to commit, knowingly participates in,
        aids and abets, or commits any act of terrorism, or any
        criminal act related to or resulting from such act of
        terrorism; or
            (2) participates in a conspiracy to commit any such
        act of terrorism or any such criminal act.

        anti-terrorism technology to Federal and non-Federal
        Government customers (``Seller'') shall obtain
        liability insurance of such types and in such amounts
        as shall be required in accordance with this section
        and certified by the Secretary to satisfy otherwise
        compensable third-party claims arising out of, relating
        to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when
        qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been
        deployed in defense against or response or recovery
        from such act.
            (2) Maximum amount.--For the total claims related
        to 1 such act of terrorism, the Seller is not required
        to obtain liability insurance of more than the maximum
        amount of liability insurance reasonably available from
        private sources on the world market at prices and terms
        that will not unreasonably distort the sales price of
        Seller's anti-terrorism technologies.
            (3) Scope of coverage.--Liability insurance
        obtained pursuant to this subsection shall, in addition
        to the Seller, protect the following, to the extent of
        their potential liability for involvement in the
        manufacture, qualification, sale, use, or operation of
        qualified anti-terrorism technologies deployed in
        defense against or response or recovery from an act of
        terrorism:

                and vendors of the customer.
            (4) Third party claims.--Such liability insurance
        under this section shall provide coverage against third
        party claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting
        from the sale or use of anti-terrorism technologies.
    (b) Reciprocal Waiver of Claims.--The Seller shall enter
into a reciprocal waiver of claims with its contractors,
subcontractors, suppliers, vendors and customers, and
contractors and subcontractors of the customers, involved in
the manufacture, sale, use or operation of qualified anti-
terrorism technologies, under which each party to the waiver
agrees to be responsible for losses, including business
interruption losses, that it sustains, or for losses sustained
by its own employees resulting from an activity resulting from
an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies
have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery
from such act.
    (c) Extent of Liability.--Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, liability for all claims against a Seller
arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of
terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been
deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such
act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller,
whether for compensatory or punitive damages or for
contribution or indemnity, shall not be in an amount greater
than the limits of liability insurance coverage required to be
maintained by the Seller under this section.

    \1\ Section 103(3) of Public Law 108-7 (117 Stat. 529) amends
subsection (b) by inserting ``Except as authorized by section 2601 of
title 10, United States Code, and by section 93 of title 14, United
States Code,'' before the word ``Gifts'' in the second place it appears
and by striking the letter ``G'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``g'' in
the word ``Gifts'' in the second place it appears. The word ``Gifts''
appears once in the text, however, the amendments have been executed to
reflect the probable intent of Congress.

        separately from the rest of the review and evaluation.

SEC. 886. [6 U.S.C. 466] SENSE OF CONGRESS REAFFIRMING THE CONTINUED
                    IMPORTANCE AND APPLICABILITY OF THE POSSE COMITATUS
                    ACT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Section 1385 of title 18, United States Code
        (commonly known as the ``Posse Comitatus Act''),
        prohibits the use of the Armed Forces as a posse
        comitatus to execute the laws except in cases and under
        circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution
        or Act of Congress.
            (2) Enacted in 1878, the Posse Comitatus Act was
        expressly intended to prevent United States Marshals,
        on their own initiative, from calling on the Army for
        assistance in enforcing Federal law.
            (3) The Posse Comitatus Act has served the Nation
        well in limiting the use of the Armed Forces to enforce
        the law.
            (4) Nevertheless, by its express terms, the Posse
        Comitatus Act is not a complete barrier to the use of
        the Armed Forces for a range of domestic purposes,
        including law enforcement functions, when the use of
        the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress or
        the President determines that the use of the Armed
        Forces is required to fulfill the President's
        obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly
        in time of war, insurrection, or other serious
        emergency.
            (5) Existing laws, including chapter 15 of title
        10, United States Code (commonly known as the
        ``Insurrection Act''), and the Robert T. Stafford
        Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C.
        5121 et seq.), grant the President broad powers that
        may be invoked in the event of domestic emergencies,
        including an attack against the Nation using weapons of
        mass destruction, and these laws specifically authorize
        the President to use the Armed Forces to help restore
        public order.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress reaffirms the continued
importance of section 1385 of title 18, United States Code, and
it is the sense of Congress that nothing in this Act should be

SEC. 891. [6 U.S.C. 481] SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the
``Homeland Security Information Sharing Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Government is required by the
        Constitution to provide for the common defense, which
        includes terrorist attack.
            (2) The Federal Government relies on State and
        local personnel to protect against terrorist attack.
            (3) The Federal Government collects, creates,
        manages, and protects classified and sensitive but
        unclassified information to enhance homeland security.
            (4) Some homeland security information is needed by
        the State and local personnel to prevent and prepare
        for terrorist attack.
            (5) The needs of State and local personnel to have
        access to relevant homeland security information to
        combat terrorism must be reconciled with the need to
        preserve the protected status of such information and
        to protect the sources and methods used to acquire such
        information.
            (6) Granting security clearances to certain State
        and local personnel is one way to facilitate the
        sharing of information regarding specific terrorist
        threats among Federal, State, and local levels of
        government.
            (7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or
        otherwise adapt classified information so it may be
        shared with State and local personnel without the need
        for granting additional security clearances.
            (8) State and local personnel have capabilities and
        opportunities to gather information on suspicious
        activities and terrorist threats not possessed by
        Federal agencies.
            (9) The Federal Government and State and local
        governments and agencies in other jurisdictions may
        benefit from such information.
            (10) Federal, State, and local governments and
        intelligence, law enforcement, and other emergency
        preparation and response agencies must act in
        partnership to maximize the benefits of information
        gathering and analysis to prevent and respond to
        terrorist attacks.
            (11) Information systems, including the National
        Law Enforcement Telecommunications System and the
        Terrorist Threat Warning System, have been established
        for rapid sharing of classified and sensitive but
        unclassified information among Federal, State, and
        local entities.
            (12) Increased efforts to share homeland security
        information should avoid duplicating existing
        information systems.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that
Federal, State, and local entities should share homeland
security information to the maximum extent practicable, with
special emphasis on hard-to-reach urban and rural communities.

SEC. 892. [6 U.S.C. 482] FACILITATING HOMELAND SECURITY INFORMATION
                    SHARING PROCEDURES.

    (a) Procedures for Determining Extent of Sharing of
Homeland Security Information.--
            (1) The President shall prescribe and implement
        procedures under which relevant Federal agencies--
                    (A) share relevant and appropriate homeland
                security information with other Federal
                agencies, including the Department, and
                appropriate State and local personnel;
                    (B) identify and safeguard homeland
                security information that is sensitive but
                unclassified; and
                    (C) to the extent such information is in
                classified form, determine whether, how, and to
                what extent to remove classified information,
                as appropriate, and with which such personnel
                it may be shared after such information is
                removed.
            (2) The President shall ensure that such procedures
        apply to all agencies of the Federal Government.
            (3) Such procedures shall not change the
        substantive requirements for the classification and
        safeguarding of classified information.
            (4) Such procedures shall not change the
        requirements and authorities to protect sources and
        methods.
    (b) Procedures for Sharing of Homeland Security
Information.--
            (1) Under procedures prescribed by the President,
        all appropriate agencies, including the intelligence
        community, shall, through information sharing systems,
        share homeland security information with Federal
        agencies and appropriate State and local personnel to
        the extent such information may be shared, as
        determined in accordance with subsection (a), together
        with assessments of the credibility of such
        information.
            (2) Each information sharing system through which
        information is shared under paragraph (1) shall--
                    (A) have the capability to transmit
                unclassified or classified information, though
                the procedures and recipients for each
                capability may differ;
                    (B) have the capability to restrict
                delivery of information to specified subgroups
                by geographic location, type of organization,
                position of a recipient within an organization,
                or a recipient's need to know such information;
                    (C) be configured to allow the efficient
                and effective sharing of information; and
                    (D) be accessible to appropriate State and
                local personnel.
            (3) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1)
        shall establish conditions on the use of information
        shared under paragraph (1)--
                    (A) to limit the redissemination of such
                information to ensure that such information is
                not used for an unauthorized purpose;
                    (B) to ensure the security and
                confidentiality of such information;
                    (C) to protect the constitutional and
                statutory rights of any individuals who are
                subjects of such information; and
                    (D) to provide data integrity through the
                timely removal and destruction of obsolete or
                erroneous names and information.
            (4) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1)
        shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that
        the information sharing system through which
        information is shared under such paragraph include
        existing information sharing systems, including, but
        not limited to, the National Law Enforcement
        Telecommunications System, the Regional Information
        Sharing System, and the Terrorist Threat Warning System
        of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
            (5) Each appropriate Federal agency, as determined
        by the President, shall have access to each information
        sharing system through which information is shared
        under paragraph (1), and shall therefore have access to
        all information, as appropriate, shared under such
        paragraph.
            (6) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1)
        shall ensure that appropriate State and local personnel
        are authorized to use such information sharing
        systems--
                    (A) to access information shared with such
                personnel; and
                    (B) to share, with others who have access
                to such information sharing systems, the
                homeland security information of their own
                jurisdictions, which shall be marked
                appropriately as pertaining to potential
                terrorist activity.
            (7) Under procedures prescribed jointly by the
        Director of Central Intelligence and the Attorney
        General, each appropriate Federal agency, as determined
        by the President, shall review and assess the
        information shared under paragraph (6) and integrate
        such information with existing intelligence.
    (c) Sharing of Classified Information and Sensitive but
Unclassified Information With State and Local Personnel.--
            (1) The President shall prescribe procedures under
        which Federal agencies may, to the extent the President
        considers necessary, share with appropriate State and
        local personnel homeland security information that
        remains classified or otherwise protected after the
        determinations prescribed under the procedures set
        forth in subsection (a).
            (2) It is the sense of Congress that such
        procedures may include 1 or more of the following
        means:
                    (A) Carrying out security clearance
                investigations with respect to appropriate
                State and local personnel.
                    (B) With respect to information that is
                sensitive but unclassified, entering into
                nondisclosure agreements with appropriate State
                and local personnel.
                    (C) Increased use of information-sharing
                partnerships that include appropriate State and
                local personnel, such as the Joint Terrorism
                Task Forces of the Federal Bureau of
                Investigation, the Anti-Terrorism Task Forces
                of the Department of Justice, and regional
                Terrorism Early Warning Groups.
            (3)(A) The Secretary shall establish a program to
        provide appropriate training to officials described in
        subparagraph (B) in order to assist such officials in--
                    (i) identifying sources of potential
                terrorist threats through such methods as the
                Secretary determines appropriate;
                    (ii) reporting information relating to such
                potential terrorist threats to the appropriate
                Federal agencies in the appropriate form and
                manner;
                    (iii) assuring that all reported
                information is systematically submitted to and
                passed on by the Department for use by
                appropriate Federal agencies; and
                    (iv) understanding the mission and roles of
                the intelligence community to promote more
                effective information sharing among Federal,
                State, and local officials and representatives
                of the private sector to prevent terrorist
                attacks against the United States.
            (B) The officials referred to in subparagraph (A)
        are officials of State and local government agencies
        and representatives of private sector entities with
        responsibilities relating to the oversight and
        management of first responders, counterterrorism
        activities, or critical infrastructure.
            (C) The Secretary shall consult with the Attorney
        General to ensure that the training program established
        in subparagraph (A) does not duplicate the training
        program established in section 908 of the USA PATRIOT
        Act (Public Law 107-56; 28 U.S.C. 509 note).
            (D) The Secretary shall carry out this paragraph in
        consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence
        and the Attorney General.
    (d) Responsible Officials.--For each affected Federal
agency, the head of such agency shall designate an official to
administer this Act with respect to such agency.
    (e) Federal Control of Information.--Under procedures
prescribed under this section, information obtained by a State

to disclose information shall not apply to such information.
    (f) Definitions.--As used in this section:
            (1) The term ``homeland security information''
        means any information possessed by a Federal, State, or
        local agency that--

                training, education, and development of many
                United States citizens;
                    (B) as a condition of some of those
                supports, many of those citizens have an
                obligation to seek either compensated or
                uncompensated employment in the Federal sector;
                and
                    (C) it is in the United States national
                interest to maximize the return to the Nation
                of funds invested in the development of such
                citizens by seeking to employ them in the
                Federal sector.
            (2) Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United
        States Government to--
                    (A) establish procedures for ensuring that
                United States citizens who have incurred
                service obligations as the result of receiving
                financial support for education and training
                from the United States Government and have
                applied for Federal positions are considered in

                offices; and
                    (B) advertise and open all Federal
                positions to United States citizens who have
                incurred service obligations with the United
                States Government as the result of receiving

            (2) The cost and resources necessary to provide
        such officers with supplemental training in aircraft
        anti-terrorism training that is comparable to the
        training that Federal air marshals are provided.

        law enforcement training center for the purpose of

        standardized training comparable to the training that
        Federal air marshals are provided.
            (4) The feasibility of implementing a certification
        program designed for the purpose of ensuring Federal
        law enforcement officers have completed the training
        described in paragraph (2) and track their travel over
        a 6-month period.
            (5) The feasibility of staggering the flights of

enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall transmit to Congress
a report on the results of the study. The report may be

that enhances preparedness for disasters unrelated to acts of
terrorism, if such use assists such governments in achieving
target capabilities related to preventing, preparing for,
protecting against, or responding to acts of terrorism.

        volunteer emergency response providers who are not
        otherwise compensated for travel to or participation in
        training or exercises related to the purposes of this
        subtitle. Any such reimbursement shall not be
        considered compensation for purposes of rendering an
        emergency response provider an employee under the Fair

        those sections for the reimbursement of the cost of any
        activity relating to preventing, preparing for,
        protecting against, or responding to acts of terrorism
        that is a Federal duty and usually performed by a
        Federal agency, and that is being performed by a State
        or local government under agreement with a Federal
        agency.
    (e) Flexibility in Unspent Homeland Security Grant Funds.--
Upon request by the recipient of a grant under section 2003 or
2004, the Administrator may authorize the grant recipient to
transfer all or part of the grant funds from uses specified in
the grant agreement to other uses authorized under this
section, if the Administrator determines that such transfer is
in the interests of homeland security.
    (f) Equipment Standards.--If an applicant for a grant under
section 2003 or 2004 proposes to upgrade or purchase, with
assistance provided under that grant, new equipment or systems
that do not meet or exceed any applicable national voluntary
consensus standards developed under section 647 of the Post-
Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 747),
the applicant shall include in its application an explanation
of why such equipment or systems will serve the needs of the
applicant better than equipment or systems that meet or exceed
such standards.

            (2) Composition.--
                    (A) In general.--The planning committee
                shall include representatives of significant
                stakeholders, including--

                    (B) Geographic representation.--The members
                of the planning committee shall be a
                representative group of individuals from the

                jurisdictions.
            (3) Existing planning committees.--Nothing in this
        subsection may be construed to require that any State
        or high-risk urban area create a planning committee if
        that State or high-risk urban area has established and
        uses a multijurisdictional planning committee or

                subparagraph (A);
                    (C) develop recommendations, as

                        duplicative requirements for State,
                        local, and tribal governments,
                        including onerous application and
                        ongoing reporting requirements;
                            (ii) ensure accountability of the
                        programs to the intended purposes of
                        such programs;
                            (iii) coordinate allocation of
                        grant funds to avoid duplicative or
                        inconsistent purchases by the
                        recipients;
                            (iv) make the programs more
                        accessible and user friendly to
                        applicants; and
                            (v) ensure the programs are
                        coordinated to enhance the overall
                        preparedness of the Nation;

                recommendations under subparagraphs (A), (B),
                and (C) to the appropriate committees of
                Congress; and
                    (E) provide the appropriate committees of
                Congress, the Comptroller General, and any
                officer or employee of the Government
                Accountability Office with full access to any
                information collected or reviewed in preparing
                the submission under subparagraph (D).
            (2) Scope of task.--Nothing in this subsection

        guidance, of any grant program that exists on the date
        of the enactment of the Implementing Recommendations of
        the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, nor authorize the
        review or preparation of proposals on the elimination,
        or the alteration of such purposes, of any such grant
        program.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that,
in order to ensure that the Nation is most effectively able to
prevent, prepare for, protect against, and respond to all
hazards, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and
other man-made disasters--
            (1) the Department should administer a coherent and
        coordinated system of both terrorism-focused and all-
        hazards grants;
            (2) there should be a continuing and appropriate
        balance between funding for terrorism-focused and all-
        hazards preparedness, as reflected in the
        authorizations of appropriations for grants under the
        amendments made by titles I and II, as applicable, of
        the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission
        Act of 2007; and
            (3) with respect to terrorism-focused grants, it is
        necessary to ensure both that the target capabilities
        of the highest risk areas are achieved quickly and that
        basic levels of preparedness, as measured by the
        attainment of target capabilities, are achieved
        nationwide.

                        such variable, as weighted, correlates

        year to Indian tribes under any grant program

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
